/**
 * This is an enumeration of possible resolution values for an SPL Palette. It
 * is done as an enumeration as some values are absolute and others are relative
 * to the overall SPL Dynamic Range.
 * 
 * Note that there are two categories of values, where the first two are
 * strictly based on the number of unique color hues shown, and are based on
 * built-in limitations of standard color processing for basic image file types.
 * 
 * The second set of values are more in the acoustics domain and are commonly
 * used in visualization contexts to help users see where values pass a
 * threshold. This is especially useful for showing where sound levels double.
