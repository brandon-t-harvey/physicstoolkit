/**
 * Relative Bandwidth is a coarser concept than "Q" and is more specific to
 * particular acoustic engineering contexts where one is often more focused on
 * the practicalities of which center frequencies can be easily measured for
 * their response. The official definition dictionary definition is as follows:
 * 
 * For an electric filter, the ratio of the bandwidth being considered to a
 * specified reference bandwidth, such as the bandwidth between frequencies at
 * which there is an attenuation of 3 decibels.
 * 
 * This specific enumeration is meant to represent typical acoustical
 * measurement and detection environments, most commonly with a focus on what
 * are useful frequencies for evaluation and analysis, such as for music but
 * also for audio signals related to marine mammals, environment, sonar, etc.
 * 
 * TODO: Expand this to also cover Relative Bandwidths that are multiple
 * octaves? No need to expand in the other direction, as 1/48 octave is in
 * most cases a single frequency (depending on the octave range context).
